## 📖 What is drawbridge?

drawbridge is a tool that lets you create flowcharts, architecture diagrams, and dependency maps. You just ask Claude, an AI assistant, to draw what you need. The images appear live on an Excalidraw canvas as you watch. This means you do not need to use complicated drawing software or learn design skills. You tell the software what to draw in simple language, and it does the rest.

drawbridge works as a real-time diagram server. It understands your words and turns them into clear diagrams. This helps you explain ideas, plan projects, or show how different parts fit together.

## 🔧 How It Works

drawbridge combines AI intelligence with a drawing canvas. You give instructions to Claude, an AI assistant trained to understand technical descriptions. Claude interprets what you want and sends commands to the Excalidraw canvas.

Excalidraw is a simple online drawing tool that lets you make diagrams with shapes, text, and lines. drawbridge shows changes live as Claude updates the diagram based on your requests.

This setup makes drawing diagrams fast and easy for people who do not want to learn complex diagramming software.

## 🧑‍💻 Using drawbridge Tips

- **Be clear and simple:** Use short, direct sentences. For example, say "Draw a box labeled 'Server' connected to a box labeled 'Database'."  
- **Add details step-by-step:** Start with the basic shape, then ask for colors, sizes, or labels.  
- **Use common terms:** Words like "flowchart," "arrow," "circle," "server," "client," or "database" help Claude understand better.  
- **Ask for changes:** If you want to update the diagram, say "Move the server box above the database" or "Change arrow color to red."  
- **Save your work often:** Export your diagrams as PNG or SVG files for safe keeping.
